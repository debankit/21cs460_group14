                <ul>
                    <li> Discovering a new drug from scratch for a specific disease is a costly and time taking process.</li>
                    <li>There are major disadvantages of the existing Drug Discovery methods, for example, even after years research, only one out of 1000 hits get approved as often the active compound maybe too toxic, not bioavailable, or too costly to manufacture.</a></li>
                    <li>So we are instead applying a reverse approach. Repurposing.</li>
                    <li> Drug Repurposing involves the investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic purposes.</a></li>
                    <li> The base of our model lies in the efficient prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs).</a></li>
                    <li> Much learning has already been done in this field. However, many interactions have not yet been detected, and the accuracy of the existing models is also not very high. </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="html1.png" alt="Work Flow">

                <ul>
                    <li>The structures of the drug and the binding targets found in proteins are converted into a code that the computer can understand and use.</li>
                    <li>We will primarily be converting into SMILES(simplified molecular-input line-entry system) a line notation to describe the chemical structures using short ASCII strings.</li>
                    <li>We plan to train them and use the ML model to find the exact drug’s functional group-binding pocket of the protein interaction.</li>
                    <li>We plan to order the drugs using an efficiency score. For this, the exact parameters affecting the interaction will be considered.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li> The datasets we will be using are taken from DrugBank, SuperTarget, MATADOR, etc.</li>
                    <li>Our primary source is DrugBank but we are not fully sure about the academic license approval, therefore we have mentioned a few of the sources.</li>
                    <li>We will be using the approved drugs dataset to train our Model and for testing. We’ll also be checking using experimental drug data for drug uses.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>For the ML model we plan to first start with the normal clustering algorithms and also Support Vector Machine(SVM). We will then try to use a decision tree based Random Forest(RF) Method. </li>
                    <li>We also look forward to use the deep learning Artificial Neural Networks(ANN).

                <ul>
                    <li>We expect that our model can predict the test data results with high accuracy so as to be better than the existing algorithms.</li>
                    <li>The extended use of the model can be that whenever a new small heterocyclic molecule is synthesised by some researcher, he/she can use our algorithm to predict the molecule’s likelihood to be a drug.</li>
                    <li>Conversely by using this model researchers can save time and resources while producing a new drug as they can test their design’s applicability before even synthesizing it. (Basically, Gaussian for medicinal chemists)</li>
